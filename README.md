# AI-POWERED-DEADLOCK-DETECTION
# AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System** is designed to predict, detect, and resolve deadlocks in real-time using machine learning and automation techniques. Deadlocks occur when multiple processes wait for resources in a circular chain, preventing further execution. Our system aims to:

- **Predict Deadlocks**: Identify patterns leading to deadlocks before they occur.
- **Detect Deadlocks**: Recognize deadlocks in real-time using process monitoring.
- **Resolve Deadlocks**: Implement automated strategies to break deadlocks and maintain smooth system operations.

This project leverages **Python, Bash, and Google Colab** for implementation, focusing on AI-driven detection mechanisms.
