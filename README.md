# AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System

## üìå Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System** is an advanced tool designed to predict, detect, and resolve deadlocks in real-time using artificial intelligence and automation techniques. Deadlocks occur when multiple processes wait for resources in a circular chain, leading to system stalls. This system aims to:

- **Predict Deadlocks:** Identify patterns leading to deadlocks before they occur.
- **Detect Deadlocks:** Recognize deadlocks in real-time through process monitoring and log analysis.
- **Resolve Deadlocks:** Implement automated strategies to break deadlocks and maintain smooth system operations.

This project leverages **Python, Bash, AI-based models, and system monitoring techniques** to enhance deadlock management, ensuring system stability and efficiency.
